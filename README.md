# CSC 216 - Software Development Fundamentals - Java Course Projects
## I want to give thanks to Dr. Heckman for the creation of all projects resources and skeleton files/code for these projects. Each file that has her author tag indicates where she has added code. I want to also give her credit for her contributions to the course project for us students.
